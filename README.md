# NEP → GAA Budget Anomaly Detection

## 📌 Overview

This project analyzes how proposed government budgets (**NEP – National Expenditure Program**) change after they are approved (**GAA – General Appropriations Act**).

The goal is to **detect and explain unusual budget adjustments** in a transparent, data-driven way—especially for users who are **not technical**.

> **NEP = proposed budget**
> **GAA = final approved budget**

---

## 🎯 What Problem Does This Solve?

Government budget data contains millions of line items. While NEP and GAA data are publicly available, it is difficult to answer simple but important questions such as:

- Which budget items were significantly reduced or increased?
- Which regions gained or lost funding after approval?
- Are some changes unusual compared to historical patterns?

Most existing tools show raw numbers but **do not explain what is unusual or why it matters**.

---

## 💡 What Is an “Anomaly” in This Project?

An anomaly is **not automatically a problem or wrongdoing**.

In this project, an anomaly means:

> A **budget change from NEP to GAA** that is **unusually large or inconsistent** compared to similar items, regions, or past years.

Examples:
- A region receiving a 60% increase while most regions changed very little
- A budget item that is consistently reduced every year after proposal
- A sudden increase that breaks historical patterns

---

## 🔍 How Budget Changes Are Interpreted

| Comparison | Meaning |
|----------|--------|
| **NEP > GAA** | Budget was **reduced** during approval |
| **NEP < GAA** | Budget was **increased** during approval |
| **NEP ≈ GAA** | Budget was largely **approved as proposed** |

These changes reflect normal legislative review, prioritization, or reallocation.

---

## 🧠 How Anomalies Are Detected (Simple Explanation)

The anomaly detection follows four clear steps:

### 1️⃣ Compare Proposed vs Approved Budgets
Budget amounts are aggregated by:
- Fiscal year
- Agency
- Region
- Budget classification

Then the **difference** and **percentage change** between NEP and GAA are calculated.

---

### 2️⃣ Ignore Very Small Changes
Small adjustments are normal.

Changes below **±5%** are treated as **no meaningful adjustment** and are **not flagged**.

This avoids false alarms.

---

### 3️⃣ Compare Against Similar Regions
For each year and budget classification:
- The average change across regions is calculated
- A region is flagged only if:
  - The change is meaningful, **and**
  - It deviates significantly from how other regions behaved

This prevents regions with **0% change** from being incorrectly flagged.

---

### 4️⃣ Check Against Historical Patterns
If the same budget item behaved one way in previous years but suddenly changes dramatically, it is flagged for review.

---

## 🚨 What Does a Flag Mean?

A flagged anomaly means:

> “This budget change deserves attention or explanation.”

It does **not** hooked mean:
- Corruption
- Misuse
- Error

The system is designed to **support transparency and review**, not accusation.

---

## 🗣 Example Explanation Generated by the System

> “This budget item was flagged because it increased by 48% during approval, which is significantly higher than the typical adjustment observed in other regions and previous years.”

---

## 🛠 Technology Used (Current Prototype)

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- CSV / Parquet input files
- Reproducible notebooks or scripts

> This repository does **not require Snowflake**.
> The logic is designed to be easily portable to Snowflake in future versions.

---

## 🌍 Why This Matters

- Makes public budget data understandable
- Helps citizens, journalists, and analysts focus on meaningful changes
- Encourages transparency and accountability
- Reduces manual review effort

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Migration to Snowflake for large-scale execution
- Natural-language explanations using AI
- Interactive dashboards
- Expansion to other government agencies
